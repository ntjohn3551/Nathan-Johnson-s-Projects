# Mars Web Scraping

A picture of the final web page can be found in the main repo. Note: this screenshot was taken when zoomed out so that it could be on one image.

The button on the web page that says "Scrape new data" is used to activate the code that can be found in scrape_mars.py, which takes data from the web and uses it in this page.
