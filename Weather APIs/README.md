### Weather API analysis

Data on weather patterns across the world is analyzed in WeatherPy.ipynb, and locations of hotels in favorable weather conditions is analyzed in VacationPy.ipynb.

# Results
Results can be found in the "Graphs" folder, as well as in the screenshots of the heatmaps in the main part of the repo. To get a clickable version of the hotel heatmap, the code must be run in a jupyter notebook.

# Important Note to Use this Code
To use this code, a user must first acquire a google API key and an openweathermap API key, both of which should be put in quotes in the file api_keys.py, where the text says "YOUR KEY HERE"


# Data was taken from openweathermap.org and google.com, both through the use of their APIs.
