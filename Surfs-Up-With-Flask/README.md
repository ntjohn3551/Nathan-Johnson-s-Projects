# Analysis of precipitation and temperature data using Flask

### Method
Used a jupyter notebook for initial analysis, included as climate_starter.ipynb. Took data from the resources folder. Additionally, set up a flask server in app.py to host a basic website allowing users to query the data, including by taking custom URLs with dates in them to explore temperature data for custom time periods.
