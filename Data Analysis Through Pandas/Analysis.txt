There are two important observations which can be made from this dataset:

1.
Though this would require a deeper dive into what's going on, it would appear that as school funding per student increases, student scores decrease.
This isn't something you should take at face value, this should be the start of a bigger investigation as to why this happens.

2. 
There is a large difference between passing rates of charters and districts. Charters have significantly higher overall passing rates.
This could be because charters and districts are used in different geographical locations, or house different demographics of students.


In summary, both of these observations are easy to see in the data yet could be caused by many different things.
Using this data for anything other than a basic analysis would require a deeper dive into the causes of these trends.
