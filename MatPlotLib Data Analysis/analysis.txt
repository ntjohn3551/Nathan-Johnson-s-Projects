Analysis for Mouse Pharmaceuticals data
----------------------------------------------------

One of the most prominent anomalies I noticed in the data was that every tumor started out the same size, 
(at time 0) which doesn't seem very realistic to me, if I observed this in real life I'd take time to read 
the procedure done to give the mice the tumors, perhaps that would explain how they all started the same size 
at the same time.


The next major anomaly I noticed was that weight compared to tumor data showed that while there was a general uptrend 
that indicated as the weight of the mouse increases, the volume of the tumor will increase, there was also a notable 
pattern where as the weight of the mouse increases, the spread of the tumor volume will decrease, which I'd think 
would be the opposite, i.e., as mouse weight increases, tumor volume spread increases, this may be due to the 
fact that the pharmaceutical poorer on heavier mice, or that some of the mice lost weight over the course of the study.


The final, and perhaps most important observation to make, is that both Capomulin and Ramicane work equally well in 
reducing tumor size. If I was to continue this study, using what I've observed, I'd put a serious emphasis on comparing 
how well both medications work under varying conditions, so lets say varying mouse size, and perhaps one works better 
on a larger range of sizes, which would be the ultimate winner.
